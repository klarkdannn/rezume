By the way this is still alpha, so dont expect anything great


TO DO LIST:
* other misc. things to make the game look purrty
* proper transitions
* some sort of rewards thing

CHANGES:
* correct implementation of stage progression (that was a bitch)
* dynamic stages!

OLD-CHANGES:
* Cleaned up a lot of the code
* Added 2 guns and a bullet
* Moved the game to an object called 'gamelolz'
* Made a game manager
* Added Keyboard support
* Changed name (Pylaga sounds cooler anyways)

NOTES:
* Because the stage transition requires recompiling the stage files, it lags a bit between transitions
